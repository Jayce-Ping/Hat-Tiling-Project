## Introduction

- This repository includes all useful packages and notebooks created during the Wolfram Summer School 2023, by Bowen Ping.
- There are several packages to provide various functions to study the hat monotile.
- The multi-way grow program, also known as search algorithm, is mainly used in this project. 

## Content

- **packages**. All packages needed to study the hat monotile and its family tile - like turtle and spectre.

- **TopologicalGraph**. Use topological graph to generate combinatorial equivalent tilings of the hat aperiodic family.

- **SpectreTile-Studying**. Some ongoing study about the spectre monotile.
- **CombinatorialEq-Hat&Metatile**. Prove the combinatorial equivalence between the hat prototile and metatiles (H7/H8 in original paper), by study all possible 1/3 vertex configurations of both. A 1-1 map can be built.
